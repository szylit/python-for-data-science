A sensible question is, is a particle likely to return to its starting position and, if so, after how long. It turns out that the answer depends on the dimension we are looking at. In one dimension, the particle has a 100% chance of returning to the start and will do so on average in a finite amount of time. In two dimensions, there is still a 100% chance of return, but the expected time of return is infinite. In three dimensions, there is a greater than 50% chance of never returning to the start.
