We don't need to generate the weight of the second stock, since it is just 1 - `ran` (because those two weights need to sum up to 1). Then we can append the arrays that we created before with the returns and volatility given randomly generated weight. The returns of the stocks we can get by taking the mean of the logarithmic returns calculated before (we need to multiply the mean daily returns by 250 to achieve annual returns because there are about 250 trading days in a year). We can get variances and covariance by using the [`.cov()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.cov.html) (note that this command returns covariance matrix, you need to use `.iloc[]` to get the values that you want, and you also need to multiply them by 250)."
